# Google-BI-certificate-c2
This repository contains the project documents for the second course of the Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate. The project focuses on two different scenarios: one for a fictional company called Cyclistic and the other for Google Fiber. The documents provided include the SQL code to create the ETL process for both scenarios.

## Scenarios
### Cyclistic:
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing company. The project aims to analyze data to understand how  riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, and provide insights to understand underlying patterns.

### Google Fiber:
The Google Fiber scenario involves analyzing data to identify repeated calls for Google Fiber's call centre in a specific market. The project aims to provide insights and strategies for increasing customers' satisfaction.
